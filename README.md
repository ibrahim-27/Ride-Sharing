# Ride Sharing App Clone

This repository contains a cloned version of a ride-sharing app design created in Figma. The project was implemented using HTML and Tailwind CSS, focusing on learning outcomes related to structuring website layouts, CSS, utilizing Tailwind CSS for styling, and achieving responsiveness.

## Project Description

The objective of this project was to clone a ride-sharing app design from Figma and replicate it as a functional website using HTML and Tailwind CSS. The Figma design served as a visual reference for the layout, styling, and overall aesthetics of the app. By carefully examining the design, I aimed to gain a deeper understanding of structuring website layouts, implementing CSS styles with Tailwind CSS, and achieving responsiveness across different devices.

## Features

- Cloned the ride-sharing app design from Figma.
- Created a structured layout using HTML, ensuring appropriate sections, headers, and footers.
- Implemented CSS styles using Tailwind CSS utility classes to match the design, including fonts, colors, and spacing.
- Utilized the responsive features of Tailwind CSS to create a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes and devices.

## Learning Outcomes

Throughout the development of this project, I achieved the following learning outcomes:

1. **Structuring Website Layouts:** By cloning the ride-sharing app design, I gained hands-on experience in structuring the layout of a website using HTML. This involved creating logical sections, organizing content, and utilizing semantic HTML elements for improved accessibility.

2. **CSS Styling with Tailwind CSS:** I improved my CSS skills by using Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework. I leveraged Tailwind CSS's utility classes to quickly and efficiently style the app according to the design. This allowed me to focus more on the overall structure and functionality of the app.

3. **Responsiveness with Tailwind CSS:** Using Tailwind CSS's responsive features, such as responsive breakpoints and utility classes, I created a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes and devices. By utilizing Tailwind CSS's responsive utilities, I learned how to build responsive designs more effectively, ensuring the app looks and functions optimally across various devices.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to acknowledge the original designer of the ride-sharing app for their inspiring Figma design, which served as the basis for this project.
